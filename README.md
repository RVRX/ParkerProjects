# Senior Showcase
This Project is to be a website showcasing the senior projects of my peers at Parker. [See it Live](https://parkerprojects.info)

## Built Using
[**Slim**](http://www.slimframework.com/) - a micro framework for PHP.

[**Twig**](https://twig.symfony.com/) - PHP template engine.

_All Dependencies can be installed using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) with:_
`composer update` (must be run in the project root directory)


## Note
Some things are different in this version compared to what is live on the site, for security reasons, and due to me updating the site after posting this. This repo is just to serve as a show of the code of the site's application and stuff.
